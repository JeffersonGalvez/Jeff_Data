- Query data regarding TTC bus, streetcar and subway delays from January 2022 - September 2022
- Investigate patterns, draw insights from data analysis and utlize findings to promote data-driven decisions
- Curate a Tableau dashboard to monitor and display KPIs related to TTC delays

The Toronto Transport Commission (TTC) was chosen for this data project, because of a personal interest in Toronto and a desire to deeply undertand its most extensive public transportation system.
As a Toronto newcomer coming from the UK (where public transport is well established and widely available) it was in my best interest to become acquainted with the TTC's biggest weaknesses. Being equipped with such knowledge, should hopefully prepare me future-plan my use of the TTC.

# [European engine trend analysis 2001-2019](https://github.com/JeffersonGalvez/GDAC_capstone/blob/main/European%20engine%20trend%20analysis%202001-2019.pdf)
My first personal data analytics project, completed as my Google Data Analytics Certificate capstone project. Here, I utilize my skills in:

Influenced by my family with a passion for automobiles and a genuine interst on longitudinal changes/trends, I was intruiged to see how vehicluar engine type popularity changed in 18 years.

## Project Objectives:
- Demonstrate ability to perform data ETL on multiple data sources using MySQL
- Perform longituidnal data anlysis, discover trends of product popularity and research possible causes of data observations
- Produce insightful data visuals to effectively communicate findings
- Report all stages of the data project using RMarkdown
